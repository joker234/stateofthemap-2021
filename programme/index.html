<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>State of the Map 2021 is taking place online from <b>July 9 to 11 2021</b>. We have created an exciting program with you â€“ the OpenStreetMap community. The conference will be held on the amazing virtual platform <a href="https://venueless.org/en/"><em>venueless</em></a>. For the duration of the conference, there will be a video-stream of talks, panels, lightning talks and Q&A sessions. Additionally, there will be chat rooms for discussions and virtual sponsor booths, as well as interactive breakout sessions that can be booked by groups of mutual interest or used without prior planning.</p>

<h3 id="breakout">Self organized sessions</h3>
<p>
  Besides the main programme of SotM we offer space for self-organized sessions. A lot of topics are well placed in smaller rounds. The only requirement that we have to your topic is that it has to be related to OpenStreetMap. We use a <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/State_of_the_Map_2021/self-organized_sessions">dedicated OSM wiki page</a> for the organization of such sessions so that everybody is able to jump in without any larger formal barrier. The only requirements we have is that the participants have a conference ticket which grants them access to the conference platform that we use and that they abide to the SotM Code of Conduct.
